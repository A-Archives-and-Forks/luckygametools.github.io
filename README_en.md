Please pay attention when using it：

1.LuckygameTools uses the hid. dll file in the Steam directory. If it conflicts with other library tools, it is necessary to back up the hid. dll file

2.After opening the program, it prompts for installation. If it keeps prompting for initialization, it should be due to domestic network issues. Restarting the program twice should work properly

3.When the game information is not fully loaded during initial use, you can try refreshing the taskbar

4.If there is a prompt of "waiting to go online" all the time, you can turn off other accelerators and try again (this software comes with Steam acceleration function, tips, right-click ->run as administrator)
